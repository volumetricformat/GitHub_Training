What is GitHub? GitHub is a collaboration platform built on top of a distributed version control system called Git.

GitHub concentrates on three things:

1. Building a technology platform that is like no other, on which developers can create, share and grow the best code possible
Nurturing a community for developers; a safe and collaborative place that facilitates sharing, amplifies creativity, and supports the principles of open source

2. Providing access, opening up a community of opportunity, where new developers can be born and where experienced developers can hone their skills and expand their knowledge

3. The content is all written in Markdown, and the scripts are shell scripts.
